				<p>There are two clear peaks in daily reported cases, one around January 2021 and a much larger peak around November 2021. This data does not account for the first wave in March 2020, because testing was not widely available.</p>

				<p>Deaths here are defined as a death of an individual who received a positive COVID-19 within 28 days of death. We have more confidence in the quality of this data because it is harder to miss a death than an asymptomatic case. The day with the most deaths was {{ data_dict["dayOfMaxDeaths"] }}. Half of all COVID-19 related deaths to date had occurred by 22/01/2022.</p>

			<div width: 35%>
				<p>Here, a day’s mortality is defined as the day’s daily deaths divided by the day’s daily cases. Since early reported cases are likely to be an underestimate of actual cases, the high early mortality is probably an overestimate. The average mortality to date is {{ data_dict["fullMortality"] }}. However, if we split the data at 200 days in we see an early mortality of {{ data_dict["earlyMortality"] }}, and a later mortality of just {{ data_dict["lateMortality"] }}. It is unclear how much of the high early mortality can be attributed to daily case underestimation, and how much is due to real causes. The value {{ data_dict["lateMortality"] }} can be taken as a reasonable mortality estimate.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>New page for "features in development"</li>
				<li>Clean up landing page: layout, navbar, footer, favicon</li>
				<li>Add some JavaScript interactivity</li>
				<li>Page for a hypothesis test for effectiveness of vaccination on daily cases/deaths</li>
				<li>Page on time series analysis testing for seasonal COVID</li>
				<li>Serverless Python ETL tool using Google Cloud Functions to get up to date data as gov.uk publishes it</li>
				<li>Automate web-scraping for data from other sources</li>
				<li>Fully automate query update process. Currently, the database is queried every time the website is opened, which is inefficient. Queries should be re-run on database update</li>
